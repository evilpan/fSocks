# fSocks

# How it works?

For every CONNECT request from SOCKS, we do:

1) negotiate with server using password
2) when succeeded, get a random cipher from server
3) use this cipher to fuzzy the following TCP streams

for detail protocol infomation, see [protocol.md](protocol.md).

## encryption

In step(1), we MUST encrypt the password, in a way that even some
evil man in the middle capture the packet, they **CAN NOT**:

- restore the plain text infomation from the packet
- replay the negotiation using the packet

## fuzzy

We assume that most of the websites supported HTTPS at precent,
therefor strong encryption for streams is unnecessary and we just
do some simple fuzzy such as xor mapping to avoid keyword detection.
However, it's hackable, and you can roll your own quite easily.


## considerations

- [x] Prevent idle TCP connection(using timeout)
- [x] Prevent brute force attack(blacklist ip manually/automaticly)


## available ciphers(for fuzzing)
It's just for fuzzing, doesn't matter if it's CRACKED if our payload
is encrypted by upper layer(such as HTTPS).
